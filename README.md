## API Usage üöÄ

Before using the API, follow these steps to set up your environment in Postman, depending on whether you are in a development or production environment:

### Development Environment

1. Open Postman.

2. Create or open your Postman collection.

3. Set the following variables in your Postman environment:

   - `{{URL}}`: Set this variable to your development server's hostname and port (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or `http://www.example.com:8080`). This will be the base URL for your API requests.

   - `{{password}}`: Set this variable to your user password. This is necessary for authentication in the development environment.

### Production Environment

1. Open Postman.

2. Create or open your Postman collection.

3. Set the following variables in your Postman environment:

   - `{{URL}}`: Set this variable to your production server's hostname (e.g., `https://api.example.com`). This will be the base URL for your API requests in the production environment.

   - `{{password}}`: Set this variable to your user password. This is necessary for authentication in the production environment.

Once you've set up the environment variables, you can start making API requests using the defined variables for the URL and password. This allows you to easily switch between development and production environments without modifying individual request URLs.
